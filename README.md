# JiraTime

A streamlined browser extension for tracking time in Jira.

## Motivation

Due to new regulations mandating comprehensive work tracking for all employees, a simplification of the process has become necessary. Not all IT staff are familiar with JIRA, nor do they necessarily wish to use it. Furthermore, not every team member processes tickets in a traditional manner; some work without tickets or outside the standard workflow entirely.

In any case: this browser extension is designed for all those who desire a streamlined approach to booking their hours—and who use a proper browser (i.e., *not* Firefox).

## Features

-   **Seamless Integration**: Connects directly to your Jira instance via Personal Access Token (PAT).
-   **Smart List**: Automatically displays your "In Progress" tickets based on customizable filters.
-   **Live Timer**: Start and stop timers directly from the extension toolbar.
-   **Manual Entry**: Quickly log time (e.g., "1h 30m") with a few keystrokes.
-   **Pinned Tickets**: Manually track specific tickets (like Epics or administrative tasks) by ID.
-   **Visual Clarity**: Clean interface with Issue Type icons and Status indicators.

## Development
